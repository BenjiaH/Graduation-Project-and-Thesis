题目：基于比幅法和相位干涉仪融合的无源测向与定位算法研究

Title: Research on Passive Direction Finding and Positioning Algorithm Based on the Fusion of Amplitude Ratio Method and Phase Interferometer

摘要：近年来，电磁频谱环境愈加恶劣，部分“非合作”信号对电磁环境产生严重的干扰，甚至是违法犯罪行为。本文以“非合作”无人机为例，重点介绍无人机在特殊区域，如机场等环境下的测向与定位方法。由于环境的特殊性，本文使用无源雷达来进行探测，并设计了四路独立的接收通道，分别通过比幅法和相位干涉仪进行测向，当具备两个测向站时，可通过到达角度（Angle of Arrival, AoA）定位算法给出信号源的具体坐标，同时，使用了神经网络对比幅法和相位干涉仪给出的方位角及坐标进行信息融合。最终，通过训练的模型来优化定位结果，准确率达到了99.82%。

Abstract: In recent years, the electromagnetic spectrum has become increasingly hostile and a number of 'non-cooperative' signals have emerged which can cause serious interference to the electromagnetic environment and even criminal offences. In this paper, we take the example of 'non-cooperative' UAVs and focus on the method of direction finding and positioning of UAVs in special areas such as airports. Due to the specificity of the environment, passive radar is used for detection. The design uses four independent antenna channels, which are used to find direction by the amplitude ratio method and phase interferometer methods respectively. When two direction finding stations are available, the specific coordinates of the source are given by the angle of arrival (AoA) positioning algorithm. At the same time, a neural network was used to fuse the information with the azimuth and the final coordinates given by the contrast amplitude method and the phase interferometer. In the end, the trained model was used to optimise the positioning results with an accuracy of 99.82%.
